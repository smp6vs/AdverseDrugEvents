# AdverseDrugEvents


Graduate students, Serena Patel and Kristi Dunks, created this model and wrote this paper (pdf in repository) for Data Analytics III in the Master's in Business Anlytics program at UVA on 3/30/2019. The goal was to predict the probability of severe adverse reactions to medications using data on users, the medications users take, and text where users self report adverse reactions in an app (e.g., "I have been having bad stomach aches and back pains"). We utilized NLP and machine learning to predict the probability an event was severe.
